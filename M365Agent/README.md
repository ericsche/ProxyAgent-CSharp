# Azure Agent for Microsoft 365

An intelligent agent that helps with Azure operations and tasks, built with Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit.

## Quick Start

### Local Development (Debugging)
1. Press **F5** in VS Code to start debugging
2. Agent is **automatically sideloaded in Teams/M365 Copilot**
3. Test directly in Teams or Copilot with full debugging support

**Full Setup Guide:** See [LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md](LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Azure Production Deployment
1. Configure environment variables in `env/.env.dev`
2. Run `atk provision --env dev` to create Azure resources
3. Run `atk deploy --env dev` to deploy your bot
4. Install in Microsoft Teams

**Full Deployment Guide:** See [AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md](AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Local Debug without SSO
1. Activate the #define DISABLE_SSO flag in AzureAgent.cs file 
2. Install the Microsoft 365 Agents Playground: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/agents-sdk/test-with-toolkit-project?tabs=windows
3. In VS, set the debugging target to "AzureAgentToM365ATK"
4. In a terminal, use 'az login' and use an account that can call the Azure AI Foundry agent. This will be used by the DefaultAzureCredentials call. 
5. Press F5 to start debugging, find the http endpoint in the debug console
6. Launch in a terminal: 'agentsplayground -e "http://localhost:<your-agent-port>/api/messages"

## Architecture

This solution deploys a complete M365 Agent infrastructure:

- **Local Development**: Bot runs on your machine, uses devtunnel for Teams connectivity
- **Azure Production**: Fully deployed to Azure with Managed Identity, App Service, and Bot Service

### Azure Resources (Production)
- User Assigned Managed Identity (bot identity)
- Azure App Service (hosts .NET 9 bot)
- Azure Bot Service (Teams integration)
- Entra ID App Registration (SSO)
- OAuth Connection (token exchange)

### Azure Resources (Local Development)
- App Registration (bot identity with client secret)
- Azure Bot Service (Teams integration with dynamic endpoint)
- SSO App Registration (federated credentials)
- OAuth Connection
